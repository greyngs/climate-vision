## üîç About Watershed

The watershed algorithm is a technique for image segmentation that relies on topography. It views the image as a topographic landscape where:
- Bright areas are like "mountains"
- Dark areas are akin to "valleys"

This algorithm mimics the flooding of the landscape starting from local low points, forming partitions when different flood basins converge.

When it comes to detecting snow and ice, the watershed method shines due to its knack for pinpointing clear edges between regions with varying brightness levels.
